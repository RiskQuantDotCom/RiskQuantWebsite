  heading: Strategic approaches.
  description: Companies have to respond urgently, but also seek to reduce cyber risk smartly, in their world of limited resources and time. The inevitable question of "What is to be done?" is asked and the knee jerk response is usually "secure everything just in case". The result becomes rampant CapEx spending on additional IT controls and oversight that then demands even more OpEx resourcing but with no clear goal or end in sight. This is unsustainable and an ineffective approach.

  heading: In tune, business aligned.
  description: The problem is never deploying more tactical controls but rather deciding how to spend the limited resources and time to meet a clear business aligned goal. In cyber security that goal is that your systems are dependable in the presence of malice, error or mischance. Responsible decision making in the face of uncertainty requires a cyber risk management approach with dependable metrics and measures to show how you are performing now and to inform you what you should do next.

  heading: Measurable outcomes.
  description: Without referring to cyber risk reduction the budget you can spend on new cyber security capabilities literally has no bounds beyond continuing to spend even more money. With a clear set of performance measures you can be sure of your current performance and you will be able to gauge the suitability or effectiveness of different cyber risk reduction decisions objectively. With reliable performance measurement you can reduce risk to within your target appetite at less cost.
