### 

You give us a specification, we agree the price and the timescale, and then we deliver a working system back to you.

This gives you:

A) A fixed cost and a fixed timescale;

B) Total ownership of the work after delivery;

C) Documentation for further development or end users;

D) Training in how to use it if appropriate.
