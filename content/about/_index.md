### Cyber Risk Quant is a challenger, in the sense that we challenge you to do better, to push your thinking and to provide you with a new and different way to see effective cyber security. 

Our key distinguishing feature is our focus and clarity that we are pursuing a niche strategy. What that means is we are forced to be selective in the work we do. We are not a general cyber security consultancy, that's not our territory. We are specialists in a niche with the aim of enhancing the relationship-led service we provide. 

There are a number of merits in working this way. One is we have considerable experience to offer you in addressing the problem of 'immeasurement'. Immeasurement is the lack of a clear means of assessing performance, progress or success on the job and over the years we have seen this in cyber security time and time again. 

It's no wonder people in cyber security burnout when they have no clear, observable link between their daily work and their purpose or mission performance. When they have no way of knowing themselves, or more importantly demonstrating to others, how they're doing it's no wonder anxiety, psychological insecurity and high levels of stress are commonplace.
