We are a challenger, in the sense that we challenge you to do better, to push your thinking and to provide you with a new and different way to see effective and sustainable cyber security. 

Our key distinguishing feature is our focus and clarity that we are pursuing a niche strategy. That niche is addressing the problem of 'immeasurement'. Immeasurement is the lack of a clear means of assessing performance, progress or success on the job and over the years we have seen this problem time and time again. 

It's no wonder people in cyber security burnout when they have no clear, observable link between their daily work and their performance relative to their purpose. When you have no way of knowing yourself, or more importantly demonstrating to others, how you're doing it's no wonder anxiety, psychological insecurity and high levels of stress are commonplace.
