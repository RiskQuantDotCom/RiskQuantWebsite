description: Knowing that cyber security risk exists isn't good enough. You need to know just how risky each risk is and the likely costs associated with different scenarios.

As more companies are shifting their business to digital channels cyber security risk is of paramount concern for executives' and Boards'. Executives clearly see the danger and are now citing cyber risk as one of the top three operational risks their businesses face. Whether operational disruption, systems failure or service restoration all cann be the result of a cyber or technology incident.

But while cyber risk is at the forefront of their minds very few have the strategy, management or tools in place to make responsible decisions about what to do. How can you make decisions without knowing what your top cyber risks are? So with so much at stake reactive and uninformed decision making based on less than the facts means if you get it wrong then you will be out of business or be sacked.

One reason for this low level of confidence is the reliance on rudimentary methods such as traffic light scales, or high-medium-low matrices deriven from untested and subjective assessments. These approaches are sub-optimal and don't qualify the levels of risk or allocate the resources accordingly. Put simply, if your decision support is weak then how can you have confidence in the quality of your critical decisions?
